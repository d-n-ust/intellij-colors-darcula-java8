# intellij-colors-darcula-java8
Darcula Color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA running on java 8

- The theme is overriding the color settings of the original darcula theme.
- The intention of the project - to archive the darcula java6 look for intellij running on java8.
- On java6 intellij looks a bit softer in colors which I like. So it would be great to get java8 on board and great look of intellij-java6 at the same time.
- tested only on **Mac OS X** platform.

Adapted languages (others may be added by anyone interested in that):
- java
- scala
- groovy

Installation
------------
